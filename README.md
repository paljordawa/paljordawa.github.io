### Post Series
To create a new series:

* Set the `title` and `description`.

To add a tutorial/post to a series:
* Add a `set` field to the tutorial front matter which points to the file name of the desired set without the `.md` extention. e.g. If I have a set at `_sets/getting-started.md` I would use this in my tutorial front matter: `set: getting-started`.
* Add a `set_order` field to the tutorial front matter and specify a number. This is the tutorials order in the set.

### Navigation

* Exposed as a data file to give clients better access.
* Set in the *Data* / *Navigation* section.

### Footer
